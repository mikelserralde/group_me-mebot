# GroupMe Memebot
Made entirely for fun, I like JavaScript, so I enjoyed the challenge of making a bot, even though it serves no purpose.
It is a bot that rates memes (or any picture really) on group me. 
Yet to be optimized, gives out ratings randomly, no actual rating system is implemented, is built for a chat with at most 8 people, but can be easily changed.
Makes for a fun group chat, send me a message if you want a template for the spreadsheet.
